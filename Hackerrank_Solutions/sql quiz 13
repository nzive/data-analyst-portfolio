# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT 
    s.user_id,
    COALESCE(ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN action = "confirmed" THEN 1 END) / COUNT(c.action), 2),0) AS confirmation_rate
FROM Signups s
LEFT JOIN Confirmations c ON s.user_id = c.user_id
GROUP BY s.user_id 

## EXPLANATION
COUNT(CASE WHEN c.action = 'confirmed' THEN 1 END):
This counts only the rows where action = 'confirmed'.
COUNT(c.action):
This counts the total number of actions (including confirmed, timeout, etc.) for each user.
ROUND(..., 2):
This rounds the confirmation rate to 2 decimal places.
LEFT JOIN:
A LEFT JOIN ensures that all users from the Signups table are included, even if they have no confirmations. This handles cases where a user has no actions in the Confirmations table.
Grouping:
The GROUP BY s.user_id ensures that the calculation is done for each user.
Handling Nulls:
If a user has no confirmations, COUNT(c.action) will be 0, and the division will result in NULL. To handle this, you can use COALESCE to replace NULL with 0.
