###  Explanation:
CROSS JOIN:
The CROSS JOIN between Students and Subjects ensures that every student is paired with every subject, even if they haven't taken an exam in that subject.
LEFT JOIN:
The LEFT JOIN with the Examinations table ensures that attendance records are included only if they exist. If a student hasn't taken an exam in a particular subject, the attended_exams count will be 0.
Join Condition:
The LEFT JOIN condition includes both s.student_id = e.student_id and su.subject_name = e.subject_name. This ensures that the join is performed correctly for both student and subject.
COUNT(e.student_id):
The COUNT(e.student_id) counts only the rows where there is a matching record in the Examinations table. If no exam record exists for a student-subject pair, the count will be 0.
GROUP BY:
The GROUP BY clause groups the results by student_id, student_name, and subject_name to ensure proper aggregation.
ORDER BY:
The results are ordered by student_id and subject_name as required.
