## Write your MySQL query statement below
  
SELECT 
    tt.id
FROM Weather as tt
LEFT JOIN Weather as yt on tt.recordDate = DATE_ADD(yt.recordDate, INTERVAL 1 DAY)
WHERE tt.temperature > yt.temperature;



## What is DATE_ADD?
DATE_ADD is a MySQL function that adds a specified time interval to a date. It takes two arguments:

A date: In this case, yt.recordDate (the date from the yt alias, which represents "yesterday's table").

An interval: In this case, INTERVAL 1 DAY, which means "add 1 day to the date."

The result of DATE_ADD(yt.recordDate, INTERVAL 1 DAY) is a new date that is exactly one day after yt.recordDate.##
