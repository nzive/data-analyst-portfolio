    s.year AS first_year,
    s.quantity,
    s.price
FROM Sales s

    SELECT
        product_id,
        MIN(year) AS first_year

ON s.product_id = first_year_sales.product_id AND s.year = first_year_sales.first_year;

##\Subquery (first_sales):
The subquery calculates the first year (MIN(year)) each product was sold.
It groups the results by product_id to ensure we get the first year for each product.
The result of this subquery is a temporary table (first_year_sales) with columns product_id and first_year.
Main Query:
The main query joins the Sales table (s) with the first_sales subquery.
The join condition ensures that we only select rows from the Sales table where:
The product_id matches.
The year matches the first_year calculated in the subquery.
The selected columns are product_id, year (renamed as first_year), quantity, and price.
