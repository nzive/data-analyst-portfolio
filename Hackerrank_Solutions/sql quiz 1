SELECT *
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary = (
  SELECT
  MAX(Salary) FROM Employees

The subquery (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee) computes the maximum salary from the Employee table.
The main query SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE Salary = ... selects the rows from the Employee table where the salary equals the maximum salary computed by the subquery##
