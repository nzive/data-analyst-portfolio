##
xplanation:
WITH RECURSIVE Numbers AS (...): This CTE generates numbers starting from 2 up to 1000.
GROUP_CONCAT(L SEPARATOR '&') AS PrimeNumbers: Combines the prime numbers into a single output, separated by &.
NOT EXISTS (...) Subquery: Checks for non-prime numbers by verifying if there are any divisors other than 1 and the number itself within the range.
AND L <= 1000: Ensures that the query only considers numbers up to 1000 for primality testing.
Usage:
This query will list all prime numbers up to 1000, concatenated with & as the separator. If you need a different upper limit, you can replace 1000 with your desired number.##
