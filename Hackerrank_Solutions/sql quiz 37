# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN id % 2 = 1 AND id < (SELECT MAX(id) FROM Seat) THEN id+1
        WHEN id % 2 = 0 THEN id-1
        ELSE id
    END AS id,
    student
FROM Seat
ORDER BY id ASC

##
Explanation:
CASE Statement:
WHEN id % 2 = 1 AND id < (SELECT MAX(id) FROM Seat):
If the id is odd and not the last student, swap it with the next id by adding 1.
WHEN id % 2 = 0:
If the id is even, swap it with the previous id by subtracting 1.
ELSE id:
If the id is odd and the last student, keep the id unchanged.
ORDER BY id:
Ensures the result is ordered by id in ascending order.
