SELECT s.Name
FROM Students s
JOIN Friends f ON s.ID = f.ID
JOIN Packages p1 ON s.ID = p1.ID
JOIN Packages p2 ON f.Friend_ID = p2.ID
WHERE p2.Salary > p1.Salary
ORDER BY p2.Salary;

Explanation:
Joining Tables:
We start by joining Students with Friends on ID to link students with their best friends.
Then, we join Packages twice:
p1 is for the student's own salary (s.ID = p1.ID).
p2 is for the friend's salary (f.Friend_ID = p2.ID).
Condition for Higher Salary:
The WHERE clause checks if the friend's salary (p2.Salary) is greater than the student's salary (p1.Salary).
Output and Sorting:
We select the Name from the Students table for those who meet the condition.
The results are ordered by the friend's salary (p2.Salary) in ascending order, which ensures the names are listed by the salary amount offered to the best friends.
