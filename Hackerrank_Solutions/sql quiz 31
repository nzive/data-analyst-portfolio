##
To determine if the values of three columns x, y, and z can form a triangle, you can use the triangle inequality theorem. 
According to this theorem, for three lengths to form a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. In other words, the following conditions must be true:
x+y>z
x+z>y
y+z>x
If all three conditions are satisfied, the values of x, y, and z can form a triangle.
