# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT 
    id,
    movie, description, rating
FROM Cinema
WHERE description != "boring"
AND id % 2 = 1
ORDER BY rating DESC 


## Explanation:
WHERE id % 2 = 1:
This condition ensures that only rows with odd-numbered IDs are selected. The modulus operator % checks if the remainder of id divided by 2 is 1, which indicates an odd number.
