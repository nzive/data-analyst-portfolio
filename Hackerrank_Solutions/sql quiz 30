# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT
    employee_id,
    department_id
FROM Employee
WHERE primary_flag = 'Y'

UNION

SELECT
    employee_id,
    department_id
FROM Employee
GROUP BY employee_id
HAVING COUNT(*) = 1;

##
First Part (WHERE primary_flag = 'Y'):
This selects all employees who have explicitly marked a department as their primary department (primary_flag = 'Y').
Second Part (GROUP BY employee_id HAVING COUNT(*) = 1):
This selects employees who belong to only one department. Since they have only one department, it is automatically their primary department, regardless of the primary_flag.
UNION:
Combines the results from both parts. UNION automatically removes duplicates, so there's no risk of duplicate rows.
