# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT 
    m.name AS name
FROM Employee e
JOIN Employee m ON e.managerId = m.id
GROUP BY m.id, m.name
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5



##Self-Join:
Employee e represents the employees.
Employee m represents the managers.
The join condition e.managerId = m.id ensures that we map each employee to their manager.
Group by Manager:
We group by m.id and m.name to count the number of direct reports for each manager.
Count Direct Reports:
COUNT(*) counts the number of direct reports for each manager.
Filter with HAVING:
The HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5 clause ensures that only managers with at least 5 direct reports are included.
Select Manager's Name:
We select the name of the manager from the m table.
