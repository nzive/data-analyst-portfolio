# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT 
    DISTINCT num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM (
    SELECT 
        num, 
        LEAD(num, 1) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS next_num,
        LEAD(num, 2) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS next_next_num
    FROM logs
) temp
WHERE num = next_num AND num = next_next_num;

##
LEAD(num, 1) → Checks the next row's num.
LEAD(num, 2) → Checks the row after next.
WHERE num = next_num AND num = next_next_num → Ensures three consecutive occurrences.
