# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT 
    person_name
FROM (
    SELECT 
        person_name,
        weight,
        turn,
        SUM(weight) OVER (ORDER BY turn) AS total_weight
    FROM Queue
) AS subquery
WHERE total_weight <= 1000
ORDER BY turn DESC
LIMIT 1;

##
Subquery with SUM() and OVER():
The SUM(weight) OVER (ORDER BY turn) calculates the running total of weights ordered by turn.
This gives us a cumulative sum for each row.
Filtering with WHERE:
The outer query filters rows where the running_total is less than or equal to 1000.
Ordering and Limiting:
The ORDER BY turn DESC ensures that the last person in the queue (with the highest turn) is selected.
The LIMIT 1 ensures only one row (the last person) is returned.
