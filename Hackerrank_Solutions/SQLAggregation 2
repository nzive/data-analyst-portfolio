select 
    ceil(avg(salary)-avg(replace(salary,0,''))) AS ErrorAmount
from EMPLOYEES;


# Explanation:
# AVG(salary): Computes the average of the salary column in the EMPLOYEES table.
# REPLACE(salary, 0, ''): Removes the zeros from the salary values, simulating the error in salary calculation.
# AVG(REPLACE(salary, 0, '')): Computes the average of the modified salaries after zeros have been removed.
# AVG(salary) - AVG(REPLACE(...)): Calculates the difference between the actual average salary and the miscalculated average salary.
# CEIL(...): Applies the ceiling function to ensure the result is rounded up to the next integer.
# AS ErrorAmount: Alias for the result column representing the error amount.
