# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT 
    r.contest_id,
    ROUND((COUNT(r.user_id) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Users)) * 100, 2) AS percentage
FROM Users u
JOIN Register r ON u.user_id = r.user_id
GROUP BY r.contest_id
ORDER BY percentage DESC, r.contest_id ASC

##
Explanation:
COUNT(r.user_id):
Counts the number of users registered in each contest.
(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Users):
Subquery to get the total number of users in the Users table.
ROUND((COUNT(r.user_id) * 100.0) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Users), 2):
Calculates the percentage of users registered in each contest relative to the total number of users.
Multiplies by 100.0 to ensure the result is a decimal (floating-point) value.
Rounds the result to 2 decimal places.
GROUP BY r.contest_id:
Groups the results by contest_id to calculate the percentage for each contest.
ORDER BY percentage DESC:
Orders the results by percentage in descending order (optional).
