# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT 
    us.product_id,
   COALESCE(ROUND(SUM(p.price * us.units) / SUM(us.units), 2), 0) AS average_price
FROM Prices p
LEFT JOIN Unitssold us ON P.product_id = us.product_id
AND us.purchase_date BETWEEN P.start_date  AND P.end_date  
GROUP BY us.product_id

##
Steps to Solve:
Join the Prices and UnitsSold tables on product_id and ensure that the purchase_date falls within the start_date and end_date range.
Calculate the total revenue for each product by multiplying the price by the units sold.
Sum the total revenue and total units sold for each product.
Calculate the average price by dividing the total revenue by the total units sold.
Round the average price to 2 decimal places.
Handle products with no sales by using a LEFT JOIN and setting their average price to 0.
