# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT 
    r.contest_id,
    ROUND((COUNT(r.user_id)* 100.0) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Users), 2) AS percentage
FROM Users u
JOIN Register r ON u.user_id = r.user_id
GROUP BY r.contest_id
ORDER BY percentage DESC, r.contest_id ASC


##Explanation
Calculate Percentage:
We compute the percentage using (COUNT(user_id) * 100.0) / total_users, ensuring multiplication by 100.0 for floating-point precision.
If we used just COUNT(r.user_id) / COUNT(user_id), it would perform integer division, leading to incorrect results (e.g., truncation to 0 for small fractions).
