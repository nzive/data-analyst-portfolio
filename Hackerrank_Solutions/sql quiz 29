##
Self-Join:
The Employees table is joined with itself:
m represents managers.
e represents direct reports.
The join condition m.employee_id = e.reports_to ensures that we are matching managers with their direct reports.
Aggregation:
COUNT(e.employee_id) counts the number of direct reports for each manager.
ROUND(AVG(e.age), 0) calculates the average age of the direct reports and rounds it to the nearest integer.
Grouping:
The results are grouped by the manager's employee_id and name to ensure proper aggregation.
Ordering:
The final result is ordered by employee_id.
