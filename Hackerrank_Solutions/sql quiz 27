# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT 
    MAX(num) AS num
FROM (
    SELECT
        num
    FROM MyNumbers
    GROUP BY num
    HAVING COUNT(num) =1
) AS single_number

##
Subquery:
The subquery groups the numbers by num and filters groups where the count of num is exactly 1 (i.e., numbers that appear only once).
The result of the subquery is a list of numbers that occur only once.
Outer Query:
The outer query selects the maximum number (MAX(num)) from the list of single-occurrence numbers returned by the subquery.
